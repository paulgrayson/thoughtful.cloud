Whether it’s the results of a search on Google, Amazon, an ecommerce shop or a hotels website, users
predominantly click on the top results in a list. Take a look at all these
[charts of clicks by position in Google Images](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ctr+by+position&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=FUGTUYBB78HSBcXvgdAD&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&biw=1680&bih=929).
This is common sense – we expect the best results for us to be towards the top of the list.
It’s imperative that we design our websites so that we get the “right” products to the top.

Which products are the “right” products? Well “right” is a personal and occasional thing. Here are some approaches that I’ve successfully used:

1. Encourage use of filters. You are measuring how your design affects this – right? What % of users who view a list also use a filter?
1. Encourage the user to self segment by product category. For example: hotels, apartments and guesthouses are pretty different beasts.
1. Default order based on predicted revenue per impression – or put another way, users vote for products by buying them.
1. Put unavailable or out-of-stock products at the bottom. For travel products, encouraging the use of travel dates can have a big impact

Encouraging users to self segment by product category is obviously a form of filtering. I highlight it separately because it’s potentially
the most important filter and it can be used to give you a metric of demand by product category. So for example, on an accommodation website,
by destination, you can see what percentage of your demand (users) are looking for apartments (vs hotels vs guesthouses etc). This metric can
be used to improve supply. It may also be used to adjust demand – perhaps altering your advertising to get an appropriate level of demand to
match your supply. To maximise conversion, we want demand, UX and supply aligned so that they resonate..

In many companies the default ordering of products is often a highly political topic. Sometimes it rivals homepage design for the political
ire that it generates. A common concern is that this is simply putting the most expensive products at the top. That is incorrect and would
indicate a poorly designed algorithm which does not maximise conversion or revenue. I believe this often stems from a fundamental misunderstanding
of what conversion optimisation is about.

Conversion Optimisation is not about increasing revenue by selling the more expensive products, it’s about
maximising revenue by selling more of what users want. Conversion is a measure of how well our site and supply serves the needs of the users that
our marketing attracts. Conversion is a measure of user satisfaction.
