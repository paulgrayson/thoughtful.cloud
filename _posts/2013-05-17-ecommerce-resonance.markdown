> From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance), “.. resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate with greater amplitude at some frequencies than at others.”

Have you ever heard someone say, “our website’s conversion is too low, we’re not ready to start spending money on PPC/Display advertising/etc..”.
I’ve heard variations on this theme at a few companies. Often such statements receive firm unequivocal nods from around the table – conversion
is low therefore the website isn’t good, it isn’t fit for purpose.

At a high level such statements seem self-evident. However, they miss a fundamental truth about conversion optimisation: Conversion Optimisation
is not all about website UX. As I mentioned in my previous [post on ecommerce](/2013/05/15/ecommerce-get-the-right-products-to-the-top/)
> Conversion is a measure of how well our site and supply meets the needs of the users that our marketing attracts.

I’ve highlighted the 3 components of conversion: site, supply and marketing. These 3 components need to be aligned so that they resonate
– reinforcing each other not reducing each other. Think about these scenarios:

1. If a user is looking for a red sports hatch, you’re probably not going to be able to sell them a caravan (demand vs supply)
1. I want to book an apartment in Berlin on the 25th of next month but the accommodation website I just found through Google only has 4 start hotels
available (demand vs supply)
1. I’m looking at a list of insurance products but it’s really hard to find which ones offer annual cover (site but also
potentially supply and demand too)

Does your site sell what the user is looking for? Can you improve supply, aligning it so that it does? Can you improve demand to attract users who
want what you are selling – so that it’s better aligned with supply?

Can you improve your site so that users tell you what they want? Consider changing your UX so that users can self segment, identifying to you what
they want to buy. If we measure what users are looking for and share this around our organisations, we can create positive feedback loops:

* supply should look to fulfil demand
* demand should attract the right demand for the available supply
* UX should help the user tell your organisation what they want

Here’s another slightly different scenario, this time it’s about how demand mix can affect conversion, specifically what I call “early vs ready”:

> I am reading about things to do in Vancouver, I’m curious about hotels but I’m not ready to book a hotel today, it’s too early and I’m just planning (demand mix – early vs ready)

Your site may well have what the user is looking for but maybe it’s too early in the purchase cycle for the user to buy – they are “early” not “ready”. A marketing channel that attracts a lot of “early” but not “ready” will likely convert poorly. That’s fine so long as we understand that this poor conversion is a function of the marketing channel not the website.

The length of the purchase cycle, the transition from “early” to “ready” varies greatly depending on the product/service we’re selling. Having a marketing channel that is largely made up of users who are “early” but not “ready” is an opportunity but we’ll need to work hard on strategies to get the user to come back when they are ready to purchase.

Conversion is not just about site design.
